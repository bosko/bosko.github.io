Common problem that Ruby developers face on Windows is missing dll
message box that appears when they try to use gem that has extension
library. Usually these Gems are packed with pre-built binary
extensions for windows and, even though, installation passes without
any error or warning, when they try to use them they realize that dll
these Gems depend on are missing on the system.

Maybe most common Gem for which this happens is sqlite3, Ruby binding
for the SQlite3 embedded database. If sqlite3.dll is missing from the
system, after installation of sqlite3 Gem any attempt to use it causes
following message box to appear.

If two versions of a required dll exist on the system Gem might use
the wrong one and strange crashes can appear.

These errors are not limited to the Gems that have pre-built binary
extensions but can also happen if extension library was built with the
[[http://www.rubyinstaller.org][RubyInstaller's]] [[http://www.rubyinstaller.org/add-ons/devkit][DevKit]]. If development files (header and library files)
needed for the extension library to be built exist on the system while
target dll is missing gem usage\ will cause the same message box to
appear.

Frequently novice Ruby users on Windows ask question on mailing lists
why Gem is not working even if it was installed without any
error. Thatâ€™s why I made dep_walker, small utility Gem, that can be
used to check whether all dependencies for extension libraries used by
installed Gem (s) are met or not. Source of the Gem can be found on
[[http://github.com/bosko/dep_walker][GitHub]].

Usage is very simple. If you want to check all installed Gems just
invoke dep_walker with the ~-a~ switch.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dep_walker -a
#+END_SRC

And for particular gem swith ~-c~ can be used.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dep_walker -c sqlite3
#+END_SRC

More verbose output is obtained via ~-t~ and colour with ~--color~
swith. Happy dependencies walking!
