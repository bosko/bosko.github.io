I guess all Ruby and Windows users will be happy to hear that
[RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/) team is about to release
Ruby 1.9.2p0 very soon. See details in [this
thread](http://groups.google.com/group/rubyinstaller/browse_thread/thread/a9b1149f9ee77a72). It
will take some time to update documentation so be patient and keep an
eye on the project home page.
