Setting up Rails and Ruby to use MS SQL server was always painful
task. Fortunately things have changed - a lot! With new [Rails SQL
Server 2000, 2005 and 2008
Adapter](http://github.com/rails-sqlserver/2000-2005-adapter) and
Christian Wernerâ€™s [ruby-odbc gem](http://www.ch-werner.de/rubyodbc)
you can do it in a few minutes.

If you want to use these gems on Windows grab Ruby installation from
[RubyInstaller](http://www.rubyinstaller.org) site and be sure to
install
[DevKit](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/66888/devkit-3.4.5r3-20091110.7z)
prior to installing ruby-odbc.

Versions of ruby-odbc before 0.9999 do not work on mingw based
(RubyInstaller) Ruby. Luckily author was very fast and made new
version very quickly after I sent him a patch. Thanks Christian!

Both gems work well on Ruby 1.8.6 and 1.9.1 Ruby versions on Windows
with old ActiveRecords, but I hope rails adapter will be ported to
ActiveRecords 3 soon.
