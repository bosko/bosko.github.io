Setting up Rails and Ruby to use MS SQL server was always painful
task. Fortunately things have changed - a lot! With new [[http://github.com/rails-sqlserver/2000-2005-adapter][Rails SQL
Server 2000, 2005 and 2008 Adapter]] and Christian Wernerâ€™s [[http://www.ch-werner.de/rubyodbc][ruby-odbc
gem]] you can do it in a few minutes.

If you want to use these gems on Windows grab Ruby installation from
[[http://www.rubyinstaller.org][RubyInstaller]] site and be sure to install [[http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/66888/devkit-3.4.5r3-20091110.7z][DevKit]] prior to installing
ruby-odbc.

Versions of ruby-odbc before 0.9999 do not work on mingw based
(RubyInstaller) Ruby. Luckily author was very fast and made new
version very quickly after I sent him a patch. Thanks Christian!

Both gems work well on Ruby 1.8.6 and 1.9.1 Ruby versions on Windows
with old ActiveRecords, but I hope rails adapter will be ported to
ActiveRecords 3 soon.
