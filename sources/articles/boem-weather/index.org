Whenever I glance at the temperature widget on my Mac, I find myself
wishing for a way to check the weather from my natural
habitat—Emacs. That’s when I discovered the [[https://open-meteo.com/en/docs][Open-Meteo API]], and I
decided it was time to refresh my rusty Lisp skills and have some fun
developing for Emacs, not just within it.

After quite some time since I wrote my first and only Emacs
package - [[https://github.com/bosko/docker-cli][docker-cli]] I created [[https://gitlab.com/boskoivanisevic/boem-weather][boem-weather]]. It's nothing fancy or
complicated - just a simple way to check current weather, daily and
hourly forecast, designed to be unobtrusive while I work.

The package initially shows the current weather in a pop-up frame.

You can easily switch between the different forecasts using the
shortcut keys `d` for the 7-day daily forecast and `h` for the 24-hour
hourly forecast.

Package is not on MELPA and can be installed directly with
~use-package~

#+begin_src lisp
  (use-package boem-weather
      :vc (:url "https://gitlab.com/boskoivanisevic/boem-weather")
      :config
      (setq boem-weather-latitude 44.804
            boem-weather-longitude 20.4651))
#+end_src
