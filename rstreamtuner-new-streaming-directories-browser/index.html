<h1 class="title">RStreamTuner - new streaming directories browser</h1>
<p class="subtitle">2010-01-22</p>
</header><p>
I like to listen various Internet radio stations while I work. My
favourite application was <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/streamtuner">streamtuner</a> mostly because it had support
for SHOUTcast. Unluckily new SHOUTcast design cannot be handled by
<b><b>streamtuner</b></b> and future development on this application is
stopped. In other words there is a little chance for streamtuner to be
upgraded so I’ve decided to make my own streaming directories
browser - <a href="http://github.com/bosko/rstreamtuner">RStreamTuner (Ruby Stream Tuner)</a>.
</p>

<p>
As usual developing in Ruby was real pleasure and only doubt was what
to use for GUI part. I’ve started with Ruby/Tk and left it very
quickly due to very poor documentation (and probably lack of Tcl
knowledge). I had to find replacement and my primary goal was to find
library that works equally well on Linux and Windows. WxWidgets with
WxRuby gem was my final choice. Although <b><b>RStreamTuner</b></b> is still in
early development phase it is quite usable. At the moment it supports
SHOUTcast and Xiph directories, but I plan to add more as soon as I
find good one. Good candidate could be Live365 but they’ve made their
pages quite hard to parse so I’ll probably leave it for later.
</p>

<p>
Once I reach beta version, making support for new streaming
directories will be quite easy and will require implementation of just
a few methods. As a matter of act it is already so simple but I’m not
satisfied with the code and will change it once I find a little bit
more time. Code is quite rough (I had little time to make
<b><b>RStreamTuner</b></b> and was eager to get working version as soon as
possible). Besides I want to write detailed instructions how to add
support for new directories. Anyway if you like to listen Internet
radion stations and like Ruby clone <a href="http://github.com/bosko/rstreamtuner">RStreamTuner</a>. Of course if you
have suggestions do not hasitate to drop me a note and if you make
support for new streaming directory just send me a pull request and
I’ll try to grab it as soon as possible.
